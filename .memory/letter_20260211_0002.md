# Letter to Myself (Session Handoff)

**Date:** 2026-02-11

## 1. Executive Summary
* **Goal:** Full refactor of the MiniRAG landing page — restructure sections, rewrite marketing copy from product docs, add Framer Motion animations, build blog spine timeline, and improve SEO.
* **Current Status:** Complete. All 7 tasks done, `npm run build` passes clean (0 errors, 38 static pages).

## 2. The "Done" List (Context Anchor)

### Phase 1 — Foundation
* Created `src/components/ui/motion.tsx` — shared variants (fadeInUp, staggerContainer, scaleOnHover), spring configs, MotionReveal component with useReducedMotion support
* Rewrote `src/components/ui/reveal.tsx` — replaced IntersectionObserver with Framer Motion motion.div + useInView, same props API (children, delay?, className?)

### Phase 3 — New Sections (4 components)
* Created `src/components/sections/trust-bar.tsx` — animated number counters (129 Tests, Multi-Tenant, 5-Min Setup, MIT)
* Created `src/components/sections/architecture.tsx` — RAG pipeline SVG diagram with animated pathLength arrows (User -> FastAPI -> Embed -> Qdrant -> LLM -> SSE)
* Created `src/components/sections/dashboard-showcase.tsx` — 6 mini GlassCards (Bot Profiles, Sources, Chat History, Webhooks, Analytics, User Roles)
* Created `src/components/sections/security.tsx` — 4 GlassCards 2x2 grid (Argon2id, Fernet, HMAC-SHA256, JWT)

### Phase 4 — Content Rewrites (8 files)
* `hero.tsx` — "use client", Framer Motion stagger/spring animations, updated badges (129 Tests, Multi-Tenant, Provider-Agnostic, Real-Time Streaming), new subheadline, terminal shows tenant bootstrap + chat API
* `features.tsx` — expanded 6 to 9 cards (added Real-Time Streaming, Webhooks & Events, Auto-Refresh, Usage Analytics)
* `how-it-works.tsx` — marketing copy rewrite for all 3 steps
* `quickstart.tsx` — new headline "From zero to production in 5 minutes"
* `faq.tsx` — replaced all 8 Q&A with product-doc-sourced content, JSON-LD auto-updated
* `cta.tsx` — new headline "Deploy your RAG chatbot today"
* `navigation.tsx` — links: Features, Architecture, Dashboard, Quickstart, Blog
* `footer.tsx` — Product links updated to match navigation

### Phase 5 — Blog Timeline
* Created `src/components/blog/blog-timeline.tsx` — scroll-linked SVG spine with useScroll + useTransform
* Created `src/components/blog/blog-timeline-node.tsx` — alternating left/right nodes with FM slide-in, GlassCard with title/excerpt/tags/date/"Read ->"
* Rewrote `src/app/blog/page.tsx` — individual post nodes on spine (replaced date-grouped cards)
* Appended timeline CSS to `src/app/globals.css`

### Phase 6 — SEO
* `src/app/layout.tsx` — added keywords, canonical URL, metadataBase, improved OG/Twitter descriptions, JSON-LD @graph (Organization, WebSite, SoftwareApplication)
* `src/app/blog/[date]/[slug]/page.tsx` — added BlogPosting JSON-LD schema

### Phase 2 — Assembly
* Rewrote `src/app/page.tsx` — new section order: Hero, TrustBar, Features, Architecture, HowItWorks, DashboardShowcase, WidgetShowcase, Security, Quickstart, FAQ, CTA
* Renamed `widget-preview.tsx` to `widget-showcase.tsx` (WidgetShowcase export), deleted old file

## 3. The "Pain" Log (CRITICAL)
* **Tried:** Framer Motion variants with `ease: "easeOut"` as plain string in hero.tsx
* **Failed:** TypeScript error — `Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'Easing | Easing[] | undefined'`
* **Workaround:** Added `as const` assertions on the variant objects and `ease: "easeOut" as const` to narrow the type. Also `type: "spring" as const`.
* *Note:* Always use `as const` on Framer Motion variant objects to satisfy TypeScript strict typing.

## 4. Active Variable State
* framer-motion ^12.34.0 added to package.json (installed)
* No env changes, no config changes
* Old `widget-preview.tsx` deleted from disk
* Build output: 38 static pages, 0 errors

## 5. Immediate Next Steps
1. [ ] Run `npm run dev` and visually inspect all sections in browser
2. [ ] Check blog timeline with existing 5 posts — verify alternating layout
3. [ ] Test mobile responsiveness on all new sections
4. [ ] Verify `prefers-reduced-motion` disables animations
5. [ ] Verify MiniRAG widget still works (no transform on host element)
6. [ ] Run Lighthouse audit — target 90+ performance, 100 SEO
7. [ ] Commit all changes and push to main for Vercel deployment
