# Letter to Myself (Session Handoff)

**Date:** 2026-02-11

## 1. Executive Summary
* **Goal:** Integrate new blog posts from the mini-chat-rag drafts directory into the landing page's published blog content.
* **Current Status:** All requested blog posts published and deployed. Session complete.

## 2. The "Done" List (Context Anchor)
* Verified 3 existing posts (`blog_2026-02-10_letter_20260209_0001/0002/0003.md`) were already published — skipped them
* Published `blog_2026-02-11_letter_20260210_0004.md` — "When SQLite and PostgreSQL Don't Play Nice: A Date Casting Adventure" (commit `223f855`)
* Published remaining 3 posts (`blog_2026-02-11_letter_20260210_0001/0002/0003.md`) in a single commit (commit `7bf36bd`)
* All posts deployed to Vercel via push to `main` branch
* Total published blog posts now: 7 in `content/blog/`

## 3. The "Pain" Log (CRITICAL)
* **Tried:** User referenced `blog_2026-02-10_letter_20260210_0004.md` (date mismatch in filename)
* **Failed:** File not found — actual filename was `blog_2026-02-11_letter_20260210_0004.md`
* **Workaround:** Searched drafts directory with grep for `0210` pattern, identified correct filenames with `2026-02-11` date prefix
* *Note:* Draft filenames use the blog publication date (02-11) not the letter date (02-10) in the prefix.

## 4. Active Variable State
* Blog content directory: `content/blog/` (7 posts total)
* Draft source: `/Users/oliverbaer/Projects/mini-chat-rag/drafts/`
* Remaining unintegrated drafts in source: 17 files from 2026-02-06 and 2026-02-07 in `drafts-blog/`, plus older drafts in `mini-chat-rag/drafts/`
* Deployment: Vercel auto-deploys from `main` branch

## 5. Immediate Next Steps
1. [ ] Consider integrating remaining draft posts from `drafts-blog/` directory (17 files from Feb 6-7)
2. [ ] Review if any `mini-chat-rag/drafts/` posts beyond the 7 published ones should be added
3. [ ] Verify all 7 posts render correctly at https://landingpage-mini-rag.vercel.app/blog/2026-02-11
